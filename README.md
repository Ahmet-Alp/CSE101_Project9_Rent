# Vehicle Rental Management System - CSE101 Project

This is a terminal-based vehicle rental system. The project manages vehicle inventory, customer profiles, and rental reservations using Python and JSON for data storage.

The project is divided modules to keep the code organized:

-main.py: The entry point of the application. It contains the menu system and interacts with the user.
-vehicles.py: Manages the vehicle fleet, including adding new vehicles and checking availability.
-customers.py: Handles customer registration, login verification (PIN), and profile updates.
reservations.py: The core logic of the system. It handles booking, date overlap checks, and invoice calculations.
-storage.py: Manages data persistence. It loads/saves data from JSON files and creates backups.
-reports.py: Generates simple reports for system usage and revenue summary.


AI Usage Statement: Artificial Intelligence (Gemini) was used during this project as a coding assistant. I generally followed the instructions that is given by AI to continue the project. Most of the specific parts I received sample codes from AI.
